# 🧠 Logicflow - Logic Circuit Puzzle Game Simulator

A fun and interactive terminal-based game to learn and play with digital logic gates!  
Created entirely in Python, this project challenges your understanding of basic logic circuits like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and more — through levels, scoring, and timers.

---

## 🎯 What is Logicflow?

**Logicflow** is a puzzle simulator where each level presents a logic circuit question. You solve it by typing the correct output. The game gets slightly tougher as you progress and keeps track of how fast and how well you perform.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Multiple logic gate puzzles (AND, OR, NOT, XOR...)
- 🧩 Level-based gameplay
- ⏱ Timer to track your completion time
- 🧠 Score tracking and history saved locally
- 💾 Lightweight and runs fully in terminal
- 🐍 Made with Python — no external libraries

## 📸 Demo

```bash
🧩 Logicflow: Logic Circuit Puzzle Game Simulator
1. Play Game
2. View Score History
3. Exit

🛠 How to Run on Ubuntu
Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Aishwaryap015/Logicflow.git
cd Logicflow

Step 2: Run the game

You can run it directly using:

python3 main.py

Or use the shell script:

chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh

📚 Concepts Used

    Basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)

    Conditionals and loops in Python

    File I/O for saving scores

    Timer and user input

    Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) fundamentals
